# Ghost-Module
A python module designed to assess your online footprint protections.

This is my first project written in python. I just ported this one from my initial program called Reiss (C#) but it's not yet released publicly despite of being under development since last year.

## Features:
- Check IP Reputation score with various sources and calculate the mean score. (under dev)
- Auto check reputation anomalies like being detected as a vpn or a proxy server
- IPQualityScore as a reputation source
- Scamalytics as reputation source (under dev)

## Next features
- Check browser fingerprints for anomalies.
- Check browser score.
